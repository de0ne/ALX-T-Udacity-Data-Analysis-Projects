# Prosper Loan Data Exploration

## Dataset

This is an explanatory analysis of Prosper Loan dataset. In this analysis, I look at the variables that were best in predicting a loan's outcome status and also the value of the loan. The dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Summary of Findings

In this exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between TotalProsperLoans and OnTimeProsperPayments. Most of the borrowers are on time payers as the number of on time payments were high. The more on time payments, the more the number of loans taken.
Also, I look at the risk scores associated with most loans, I discovered that most risk scores are average.
Finally, I look at the impact of borrowerâ€™s income on the amount of loan, I discovered that the more the income of a borrower, the more the amount of loan.



## Key Insights for Presentation

For this presentation, I focus on just the variables that are best in predicting a loan's outcome status and also the value of the loan. I started by introducing the ProsperScore and OnTimeProsperPayments variables by showing their distribution plot.
Afterwards, I introduced the other variables of interest and showed their relationship with one another using different kinds of plots such as scatter plot, count plot, violin plot etc.
